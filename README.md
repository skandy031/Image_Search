# Image_Search
The program is supposed to produce images in relation to the keyword input into the program.
Please note that you will have to install the following libraries:
pip install jinja2
pip install requests
pip install os
pip install template
pip install json

*The program will not work if a LaTeX reader is not installed, I used Texworks, I suggest using the same for optimal results*
